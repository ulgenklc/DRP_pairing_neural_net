# DRP_pairing_neural_net

[DRP Turkey 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/drp-turkey/) project, in colloboration with [Üzeyir Saçıkay](https://github.com/1arwain), in which we develop a machine learning framework to fairly perform mentor-mentee pairings in a generic directed reading program.

Our goal is to construct neural networks that automizes such task.
